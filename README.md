# On maximum likelihood, missing data mechanism, and the EM algorithm.
Author: Akira Ishiyama

This is a repo for the individual project of the module 'Incomplete data analysis".

This repo includes 3 dataset and an .rmd file which contains answers and coding for the questions.

The first three sections of the .rmd file is on some basic aspects of maximum likelihood estimation and missing data mechanisms.

The fourth and fifth sections are on the derivation and computation of the EM algorithm for some data with missing values.
